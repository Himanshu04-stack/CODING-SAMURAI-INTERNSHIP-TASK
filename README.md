# 🔢 Java Simple Calculator

This is **Project 1** of the **Java Development Internship** at **Coding Samurai**.  
It is a smart, modular, and interactive **console-based calculator** built with core Java.  
Designed to practice basic syntax, loops, methods, and user input handling — all wrapped in a user-friendly interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📐 Performs **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**
- 🔁 **Menu-driven interface** with continuous operations
- 💥 Handles invalid input and **division by zero**
- ✨ Polished user experience with clear outputs and exit messages

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Java syntax and structure
- Scanner-based input handling
- Loops (`while`, `do-while`)
- Conditional logic (`switch`)
- Modular programming with methods
- Input validation using `try-catch`
